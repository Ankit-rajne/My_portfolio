Hi, I’m Ankit Rajne — a Python developer focused on building clean and user-friendly applications using Python and GUI tools like Tkinter. I work with MySQL to manage data and create real-world mini projects. I'm currently improving my skills in frontend technologies and aim to build interactive and useful applications.
